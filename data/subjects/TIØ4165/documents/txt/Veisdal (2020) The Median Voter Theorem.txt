The Median Voter Theorem:  
Why Politicians Move to the Center
Jørgen Veisdal
In public choice economics, the median voter theorem states that
A majority rule voting system will select the outcome most pre-
ferred by the median voter.1
In other words, the voter in the middle of the probability distribution 
picks the winner of the election. The prediction of the model, there-
fore, is what intuitively seems questionable (given today’s politics), 
namely that:
Candidates position themselves around the center.
The theorem rests on two core assumptions:
•	 Candidates and/or parties may be placed along a one-­dimensional 
political spectrum; and
•	 Voters’ preferences are single-­peaked, meaning that voters have 
one alternative they prefer over the other.
History
The dynamics and predictions of the median voter theorem made 
their first appearance in economist Harold Hotelling’s2 legendary 
1929 paper Stability in Competition,3 in which Hotelling in passing 
notes that political candidates’ platforms seem to converge during 
majoritarian elections. His paper regards the positioning of stores 
by two sellers along a line segment, in which buyers are uniformly 
distributed. The prediction of his model, now known simply as “Ho-
telling’s law”4 is that in many markets it is rational for producers to

make their products as similar as possible, the so-­called “principle of 
minimum differentiation.”
The formal analysis of the principle of Hotelling’s law in majority 
voting systems was provided in a related 1948 paper entitled On the Ra-
tionale of Group Decision-­making by economist Duncan Black.5 Anthony 
Downs,6 inspired by Adam Smith, further expanded on Black’s work in 
his 1957 book An Economic Theory of Political Action in a Democracy.
A Simple Voting Model
The principle of the median voter theorem is successfully illustrated in 
a game theory lecture by Yale economist Ben Polak,7 which is available 
through the Open Yale Courses website.8 His very simple model goes 
as follows:
A Simple Voting Model (Polak 2007)
Two candidates choose their positions along a political spectrum from 
1 to 10:

Imagine perhaps positions 1–3 being left-­wing positions and positions 
8–10 being right-­wing positions. Assume that there are 10% of voters 
in each position (a uniform distribution of voters). Assume also that 
voters choose the closest candidate to their position. If there is a tie, 
votes are split 50%/50% between the two candidates.
The question for both candidates is where they should position them-
selves along the political spectrum 1–10 in order to maximize their 
shares of the vote.
First, as candidate A, let us assume that candidate B places himself or 
herself at the extreme left, in position 1. The question we need to ask 
ourselves is then whether position 2 is a better strategy for maximiz-
ing our share of the vote. Formally, we’re asking if uA(2,1) > uA(1,1), 
i.e., whether the utility we obtain from choosing position 2 is greater 
than that we obtain if we choose position 1, given our assumption that 
the other candidate chooses position 1. We know that each position

potentially holds 10% of the votes and if both choose the same position, 
we split the election. We—in other words—know that if both choose 
position 1, (1,1), both get 50% of the votes. If we as candidate A choose 
position 2, however, (2,1), candidate B gets the 10% of votes in position 
1, but we get the remaining 90% of votes in positions 2–10 as the result 
of our assumption that voters choose their closest candidate:
We can conclude that if candidate B chooses position 1, choosing 
position 2 is better for us as candidate A than choosing position 1 (90% 
vs. 50% of votes).
Next, again as candidate A, let us assume that candidate B places 
herself or himself at the second most extreme left, in position 2. Is 
choosing position 2 still strictly better for us than choosing position 1? 
Formally, we’re asking whether uA(2,2) > uA(1,2). Immediately, since 
both are choosing the same position (2,2), we know that our payoff for 
choosing position 2 is 50%, i.e., splitting the election. If we choose po-
sition 1 against position 2, we find ourselves in the inverse of the latter 
scenario (in the figure above) and can expect a payoff of 10%. We must 
therefore conclude that if candidate B chooses position 2, as candidate 
A we are still better off choosing position 2 (50% > 10% of votes), than 
choosing position 1.
Next, again as candidate A, let us assume that candidate B places 
himself or herself at the third most extreme left, in position 3. Is choos-
ing position 2 still strictly better for us than choosing position 1? For-
mally, now we’re asking whether uA(2,3) > uA(1,3). In the first of these 
scenarios, we get all the voters in position 1 plus all the voters in posi-
tion 2 (a total of 20%), while candidate B gets all the voters in positions 
3–10 (80%). In the second scenario, we get all the voters in position 1 
plus half the voters in position 2 (since we are equally far from position 
2 as candidate B is, a total of 15%). Either way, we see that position 2

is still strictly better for us as candidate A than position 1 (20% > 15% 
of votes):
Continuing for all strategies against choosing position 1, we will find 
that position 2 always yields a higher payoff. Formally, we say that the 
strategy of choosing position 2 strictly dominates the strategy of choos-
ing position 1, for both candidates, no matter what the other candidate 
chooses. We can hence eliminate position 1 as a viable strategy, since it 
is never better than position 2 for either candidate. By considerations of 
symmetry, we can do the same for position 10 vs. position 9:
Having eliminated positions 1 and 10 as viable strategies for maxi-
mizing our number of votes, we can next perform a similar analysis, 
but now with a reduced model consisting of positions 2–9. Unexpect-
edly, an analysis of position 2 vs. 3 (and 9 vs. 8) will yield the same 
result, and so we may delete strategies 2 and 9 as well, and so on. In the 
end, our model will have reduced to two viable positions, 5 and 6; let’s 
call them “left and right.”
u(1,3): Voter shares if candidate A chooses position 1 when candidate B 
chooses position 3.
u(2,3): Voter shares if candidate A chooses position 2 when candidate B 
chooses position 3.

An analysis of this reduced model will find that if we expect can-
didate B to position herself or himself on the right, it is rational for us 
to position ourselves on the left. If we expect candidate B to position 
himself or herself on the left, it is rational for us to position ourselves 
on the right:
Our finding, in other words, is the prediction of the median voter 
theorem, namely that:
Candidates position themselves around the center.
Clean as it looks, as with any model, our model depicting the essence 
of the median voter theorem is ripe with limitations, including (but not 
limited to) the following:
•	 Voters are in reality not evenly distributed (10% at each position);
•	 There are often more than two candidates in an election;
•	 Real candidates cannot simply “position” themselves—their po-
sitioning has to be believable; and
•	 Even in referendums, there is often more than one issue being 
voted on.
