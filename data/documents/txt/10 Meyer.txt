Making Sense  
of Agile Methods
Bertrand Meyer
SOME 10 YEARS ago, I realized I 
had been missing something big in 
software engineering. I had heard 
about Extreme Programming (XP) 
early, thanks to a talk by Pete 
McBreen at a summer school in 1999 
and another by Kent Beck himself at 
TOOLS USA in 2000. But I hadn’t 
paid much attention to Scrum. When 
I took a look, I noticed two strik-
ing discrepancies in the state of agile 
methods.
The first discrepancy was be-
tween university software engineer-
ing courses, which back then (things 
have changed) often didn’t cover 
agility, and the industry buzz, which 
was only about agility.
As I started going through the ag-
ile literature, the second discrepancy 
emerged: an amazing combination 
of the best and the worst ideas, plus 
much in between. In many cases, 
when faced with a new methodologi-
cal approach, a person can quickly 
deploy what in avionics is called 
Identification Friend or Foe (IFF): 
will it help or hurt? With agile, IFF 
 
fails. It didn’t help that the tone of 
most published discussions on ag-
ile methods (with a few exceptions, 
notably Balancing Agility and Dis-
cipline: A Guide for the Perplexed1) 
was adulatory. Sharing your passion 
for a novel approach is commend-
able, but not a reason to throw away 
your analytical skills. A precedent
comes to mind: people (including
me) who championed object-oriented 
programming a decade or so earlier 
might at times have let their enthu-
siasm show, but we didn’t fail to dis-
cuss cons along with pros.
 
 
Beyond the Boasts and Good 
Intentions
The natural reaction was to apply a 
rule that often helps: when curious, 
teach a class; when bewildered, write 
a book. Thus was Agile! The Good, 
the Hype and the Ugly born.2 (Also 
see the edX online course Agile 
Software Development; www.edx.org 
/course/agile-software-development 
-ethx-asd-1x-0.) My first goal was
to provide a concise tutorial on agile 
 
 
methods, addressing a frequently 
heard request for a comprehensive, 
no-frills, news-not-editorial descrip-
tion of agile concepts. The second 
goal was analytical: offering an as-
sessment of agile boasts.
These 
boasts 
are 
impressive. 
The title of a recent book by one 
of the creators of Scrum prom-
ises “Twice the Work in Half 
the Time.”3 Wow! I’ll take a produc-
tivity improvement of four any time. 
Another book by both of the meth-
od’s creators informs us, “You have 
been ill served by the software in-
dustry for 40 years—not purposely, 
but inextricably. We want to restore 
the partnership.”4 No less! (Was any 
software used in producing that 
statement?)
The agile literature has a certain 
adolescent quality (“No one else un-
derstands!”), but ideas aren’t born in 
a vacuum. I quickly realized that the 
agile movement was best understood 
as evolution rather than revolution. 
Although you wouldn’t guess it from 
some of the agile proclamations, the

the entire agile literature, practic-
ing agile methods, and qualifying as 
a proud Certified Scrum Master, if 
I thought the approach was worth-
less.) But you need a constantly alert 
IFF to sort out the best and worst 
agile ideas.
Sorting Out the Agile Ideas
The final chapter of Agile! The 
Good, the Hype and the Ugly sum-
marizes the book’s analysis by listing 
items in each of the three categories, 
complementing the Good with the 
subcategory of the truly Brilliant. 
Here are a few significant examples 
in each category.
The Hype
Let’s start with the Hype, which can 
also be called the Indifferent: ideas 
that have been oversold even though 
their impact is modest. An example 
is pair programming: the practice 
of developing software in groups of 
two people, one at the keyboard and 
one standing by, speaking out their 
thought processes to each other. XP 
prescribes pair programming as the 
standard practice. One use of pair 
programming is as a source of re-
search papers: you can measure and 
compare the outcome (development 
time and number of bugs) of two 
groups working on the same topic, 
one with pair programming and the 
other using traditional techniques. 
Such studies are relatively easy to 
conduct using student projects in 
a university software engineering 
course.
These studies, of which there 
are many, show that pair program-
ming has no significant advantage 
or disadvantage compared to other 
techniques such as code inspection 
(for example, see “Two Controlled 
Experiments Concerning the Com-
parison of Pair Programming to Peer 
Review”8). The truth is that pair 
programming is an interesting prac-
tice, to be used on occasion, typically 
for a tricky part of the development 
requiring competence from two dif-
ferent areas, but there’s no reason 
to impose it as the sole mode of de-
velopment. It’s also easy to misuse 
by confusing it with mentoring, an 
entirely different idea.
Other examples of the Indiffer-
ent include the role of open spaces 
(although office layout deserves at-
tention, some of the best software 
was developed in garages), self- 
organizing teams (different projects 
and different contexts will require 
different styles of project manage-
ment), and the charming invention 
of planning poker.
The Ugly
More worrying are the agile recom-
mendations that fall into the Ugly 
category. Perhaps the most damag-
ing is the widespread rejection of 
“Big Up-Front Everything”: up-front 
requirements, up-front design. For a 
typical example, see “Agile Design: 
Intentional yet Emergent.”9 The ra-
tionale is understandable: some proj-
ects spend too much time in general 
preliminary discussions, a phenom-
enon sometimes called analysis pa-
ralysis, and we should strive instead 
to start some actual coding early.
This healthy reaction doesn’t jus-
tify swinging the pendulum to the 
other extreme. No serious engineer-
ing process can skip an initial step 
of careful planning. It is good to put 
limits on it but irresponsible to re-
move it. The project failures I tend 
to see nowadays in my role as a con-
sultant (or project rescuer) are often 
due to an application of this ag-
ile rule: “We don’t need no stinkin’ 
requirements phase; we’re agile. 
Let’s just produce user stories and
